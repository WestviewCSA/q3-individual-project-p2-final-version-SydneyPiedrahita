					Make sure I can push and commit changes to repository linked to GitHub classroom
					assignment. 
               		Create easy/medium/hard maps showing some understanding of the maps
               		Create easy/medium/hard coordinate-based maps showing understanding of the 2nd type 
               		of input files.
               		Be able to read in data from map files 
               			- Using Scanner
               		Be able to store data from map files
               			-  Use 2-D array
               			- Sized [rooms*rows][cols]
               		
               		
Week 2 (3/2 - 3/6): 

					Start writing code that works with Queue-based approach...
						- Notes: first-in, first-out
						- Enqueue the W starting coord, Dequeue the W coord and enqueue the coordinates
						  in N, S, E, W, check for the coin, repeat until coin is found
               		Start writing code that works with Stack-based approach... 
               			- Notes: first-in, last-out
               			- push the W starting coord, pop the W coord and push the coordinates
						  in N, S, E, W, check for the coin, repeat until coin is found
               		Command Line arguments
               			- Stack
               			- Queue
               			- Opt
               			- Time
               			- Incoordinate
               			- Outcoordinate
               			- Help
               		
               		Notes: North, South, East, West
